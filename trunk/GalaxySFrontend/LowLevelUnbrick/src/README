If you are reading this, you are doing something wrong.

This is an executable file, it should not be decompressed.

Please visit the following site to ensure you have the latest version of Java
http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp

Then right-click and open this file as an executable. 


Again, if you are trying to use this program, you should not be in here. The 
only logical reason to be in here is to extract the tar.gz file for 
redistribution or flashing in another manner other then the one-click.

If you're trying to see what makes the program tick, then visit this site
http://oneclick.adamoutler.com for source code.
